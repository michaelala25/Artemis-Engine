Back when I was a young lad, brimming with zeal and insecurity, in order to separate myself from my programming peers, the B- students who were tasked with building a video game for their final project, I decided I would build something even cooler: a *game engine*. I thought "with this awesome game engine, I'll make even more awesome games than my friends!" I would *never* stoop to making a snake-clone like my teacher suggested we make, no, I was going to make stunning platformers with cutscenes and dynamic lighting engines and massive explorable worlds. Then maybe, just maybe, Dad would be proud of me...

Alas, young people are idiots, myself included, and I wasn't prepared for the sheer scale of such an undertaking. I thought the only difference between me and the developers behind the Unreal Engine was how much redbull we consumed (and consequently, how much sleep we were willing to lose). Not too bright, was I? I sure did write a lot of code for my age, but the result was, at best, a partially finished "API" for interfacing with different parts of MonoGame more easily (and even this "easily" is debatable).

Nonetheless, I'm proud of this ambitious, albeit puerile, formative project. I had fun and learned a lot about C# and OOP. Feel free to poke around and explore what my sleep-deprived 17 year old brain could come up with.
